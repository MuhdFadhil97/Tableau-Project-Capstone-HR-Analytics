Project Capstone Tableau HR Analytics

Hey everyone,

I'm thrilled to share some fantastic news with you all! ðŸŒŸ After months of hard work and dedication, I've successfully completed my final project at the Data Analytics Bootcamp by Excelerate Asia. The title of my project was "Understanding HR Attrition Trends: A Data-Driven Analysis," and I couldn't be more proud of the results.

In this project, I delved deep into HR attrition data to uncover insights that can help organizations better understand and address attrition trends. It was an incredible journey of data exploration, analysis, and visualization. I learned so much during this process and am excited to apply my newfound skills to real-world challenges.

But the good news doesn't stop there! ðŸŒ  I'm delighted to announce that I've secured a placement as a Business Intelligence Trainee. This opportunity is a dream come true, and I can't wait to dive into the world of business intelligence, where I'll be using data to drive informed decision-making and help shape the future of my organization.

I want to express my gratitude to my instructors, mentors, and fellow bootcamp participants for their support throughout this journey. Without your guidance and camaraderie, this achievement wouldn't have been possible.

As I embark on this new chapter, I'm eager to continue learning and growing in the field of data analytics and business intelligence. I look forward to facing new challenges, exploring fresh opportunities, and making a meaningful impact.

Thank you to everyone who has been a part of my journey so far, and I can't wait to see where this exciting path leads me. Stay tuned for more updates on my adventures in the world of data analytics and business intelligence!
